	    <h3>Netflix</h3>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>
          
            Netflix is the original major streaming option for home television audiences. When it started nearly
            20 years ago, Netflix was a subscription-based DVD service that would mail DVDs straight to your home. 
            In 2007, Netflix debuted its streaming service, 
            allowing viewers to watch thousands of on-demand TV shows and movies ad-free. Ten years later, 
            Netflix has become one of the biggest names in entertainment, offering a wide range of content across every genre you can imagine. From full seasons 
            of TV shows to classic movies, Netflix has more entertainment than you could ever possibly watch.

	    <h3>Spotify</h3>
	    <br/>
	    <p>
	        Spotify was launched in 2008 and has completely changed they way people listen to music ever since.
	        By allowing users to play music directly from the cloud - rather than by downloading it first - 
	        Spotify became wildly popular, and as a startup gave entrenched music industry players like Apple's 
	        iTunes a run for its money. With over 30 million songs on offer and 20,000 being added everyday, Spotify has
	        music to match everyone's tastes. It currently has 140 million active users with 70 million of those being paid subscribers.

	    <h3> Social Media</h3>
	    <br/>
	    <br/>
	    <p>
	        Social media sites have large numbers of user scattered around the world. This makes them ideal
	        candidates for cloud adaptation.
            Social networks help boost internet usability by storing heavy multimedia content in cloud storage systems. 
            Videos and photographs are the most popular content on social media, which essentially use up the maximum
            space allotted to them. They have the capacity to slow down entire websites with their sheer weight. Cloud
            \computing vendors such as Salesforce and Amazon nowadays provide varied services including from Customer
            Relationship Management (CRM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). As they deliver these through 
            cloud servers, clients can use the flexibility and scalability of the system without purchasing standalone 
            software or hardware.

	    <h3> Icloud</h3>
	    <p>
	        <strong>iCloud For safekeeping. And easy sharing.</strong>
            iCloud securely and safely stores your photos, videos,
            documents, apps and more - and keeps them updated across all your devices. So you always have access
            to what you want, wherever you want it.
            <br/>
            <strong>iCloud Photo Library</strong>
            When you turn on iCloud Photo Library, all the photos and videos you take with iPhone or iPad are 
            automatically uploaded, so you can access them from your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac and PC, and 
            on iCloud.com. By storing all your photos and videos safely in iCloud, you'll have more space on 
            your iPhone to take even more great shots. And iCloud Photo Sharing makes it easy to show off 
            just the photos and videos you want to just the people you want to see them.
            <br/>
            <strong>iCloud Drive and the Files app</strong>
            With iCloud Drive, you can securely store all your files in iCloud and access
            them from your iPhone or iPad in the new Files app, from your Mac, from a PC 
            or on iCloud.com. And you can easily invite people to view, download or work on a file
            with you from anywhere. No creating copies, managing versions or adding email attachments.
            <br/>
            <strong>iCloud Backup and Restore</strong>
            iCloud backs up your iOS devices each night when they're connected to power and Wiâ€‘Fi,
            so you can easily restore all your information. And when you get a new device, restore 
            from iCloud so you won't lose a beat.
            <br/>
            <strong>Family Sharing</strong>
            Up to six members of your family can share iTunes, iBooks and App Store purchases,
            an Apple Music family plan and an iCloud storage plan. Family Sharing makes it easy
            to set up and share just the features your family needs. Your family will also get a 
            shared photo album that lets everyone add photos they choose to share, a family calendar,
            and the ability to help locate each other's missing devices.
