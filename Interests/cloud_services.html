        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>
          
            Netflix is the original major streaming option for home television audiences. When it started nearly
            20 years ago, Netflix was a subscription-based DVD service that would mail DVDs straight to your home. 
            In 2007, Netflix debuted its streaming service, 
            allowing viewers to watch thousands of on-demand TV shows and movies ad-free. Ten years later, 
            Netflix has become one of the biggest names in entertainment, offering a wide range of content across every genre you can imagine. From full seasons 
            of TV shows to classic movies, Netflix has more entertainment than you could ever possibly watch.

	    <h3>Spotify</h3>
	    <br/>
	    <p>
	        Spotify was launched in 2008 and has completely changed they way people listen to music ever since.
	        By allowing users to play music directly from the cloud - rather than by downloading it first - 
	        Spotify became wildly popular, and as a startup gave entrenched music industry players like Apple's 
	        iTunes a run for its money. With over 30 million songs on offer and 20,000 being added everyday, Spotify has
	        music to match everyone's tastes. It currently has 140 million active users with 70 million of those being paid subscribers.

	    <h3> Social Media</h3>
	    <br/>
	    <br/>
	    <p>
	        Social media sites have large numbers of user scattered around the world. This makes them ideal
	        candidates for cloud adaptation.
            Social networks help boost internet usability by storing heavy multimedia content in cloud storage systems. 
            Videos and photographs are the most popular content on social media, which essentially use up the maximum
            space allotted to them. They have the capacity to slow down entire websites with their sheer weight. Cloud
            \computing vendors such as Salesforce and Amazon nowadays provide varied services including from Customer
            Relationship Management (CRM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). As they deliver these through 
            cloud servers, clients can use the flexibility and scalability of the system without purchasing standalone 
            software or hardware.
