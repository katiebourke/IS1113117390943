        <h3>What is cloud computing?</h3>
        <p>
Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services,from applications to 
storage and processing power, over the internet and on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Rather than owning their own computing infrastructure or data centers, companies can rent 
access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider.
One benefit of using cloud computing services is that firms can avoid the upfront cost 
and complexity of owning and maintaining their own IT infrastructure, and instead simply 
pay for what they use, when they use it.
        </p>
            <h3>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h3>
         <p>  
Software as a Service provides you with a completed product 
that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, 
people referring to Software as a Service are referring to 
end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you do not have to
think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying
infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you
will use that particular piece software. A common example of a
SaaS application is web-based email where you can send and 
receive email without having to manage feature additions to 
the email product or maintaining the servers and operating 
systems that the email program is running on.
<br/>
<Strong>Example: Salesforce</Strong><br/>
Salesforce provides various software solutions and a platform for users and developers to develop and 
distribute custom software. Salesforce.com is based on multi-tenant architecture. This means that multiple 
customers share common technology and all run on the latest release. You don't have to worry about the 
application or infrastructure upgrades - they happen automatically. This helps organisation focus 
on innovation rather than managing technology. <br/>

        </p>
        
        <h3>Platfrom as a Service (PaaS)</h3>
        <p>
Platforms as a service removes the need for organisations to manage 
the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and 
allows them to focus on the deployment and management of applications. 
This helps with efficiency as you don't need to worry about resource 
procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of 
the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.
<br/>
<strong>Example: Cloud 9</strong><br/>
Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that 
lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a 
code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential
tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, 
and more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your development 
machine to start new projects. Since your Cloud9 IDE is cloud-based, you can
work on your projects from your office, home, or anywhere using an internet-connected 
machine. <br/>

        <h3>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h3>
        <p>
Infrastructure as a Service contains the basic building blocks for 
cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features,
computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Infrastructure
as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control 
over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT 
departments and developers are familiar with today.<br/>
<strong>Example: Amazon Web Services</strong><br/>
Amazon Web Services provides a scalable and reliable infrastructure
platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries 
worldwide, in the form of web services (cloud computing). One major benefit of cloud 
computing is the opportunity to replace large infrastructure expenses with low variable costs. 
With the Cloud, businesses no longer need to purchase servers and other 
IT infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up 
hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster.<br/>

        <h3>Communication as a Service (CaaS)</h3>
        <p>
Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications 
solution that can be leased from a single vendor. Such communications can include voice
over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), instant messaging (IM), collaboration and videoconference
applications using fixed and mobile devices. The CaaS vendor is responsible for all hardware
and software management and offers guaranteed quality of service. 
<br/>
<strong>Example: Gmail</strong><br/>
Short for Google Mail, Gmail is a free service provided by Google that enables users
to send and receive e-mail over the Internet.
Gmail is unique in that it allows you to store 15 gigabytes of e-mail data,
so most users never have to worry about not receiving emails due to lack of storage.
Gmail has many attractive functions which make it so popular among users, including 
spam detection capabilities which means almost all spam is 
filtered into the trash, so you don't have to read it, integrated search and an instant messenger service.<br/>
