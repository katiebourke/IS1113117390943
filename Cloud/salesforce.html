        Salesforce started as Software as a Service (SaaS) CRM company. 
        Salesforce now provides various software solutions and a platform for users and developers to develop and 
        distribute custom software. Salesforce.com is based on multi-tenant architecture. This means that multiple 
        customers share common technology and all run on the latest release. You donâ€™t have to worry about the 
        application or infrastructure upgrades - they happen automatically. This helps your organization focus 
        on innovation rather than managing technology.
